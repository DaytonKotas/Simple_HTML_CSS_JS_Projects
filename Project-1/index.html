    <div class="Players">
    <h2>01 Giannis Antetokounmpo</h2>

    <p>Antetokounmpo reached the NBA mountaintop in 2021 by winning a championship and Finals MVP award.
    He wasn't able to repeat in 2022 with Milwaukee after Khris Middleton suffered a knee injury at the beginning of the
    playoffs. But after averaging 33.9 points, 14.7 rebounds and 7.1 assists in a seven-game series against the Celtics,
    Antetokounmpo reminded us that he's the league's alpha right now.</p>

    <div class="Players">
    <h2>02 Kevin Durant</h2>

    <p>Durant had a claim as the best player in the world at the end of the 2021 season after going toe-to-toe with Giannis
    while James Harden and Kyrie Irving were hurt. Now joining the Suns it seems like he might be a bit unstoppable and 
    might be able to reclaim his spot as the best player in th world.</p>

    <div class="Players">
    <h2>03 Nikola Jokic</h2>

    <p>Jokic raised his game in 2021-22 to win a second-straight MVP award, this time playing almost all of the regular season
    without Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. Now with a healthy team and more chemistry he could certianly lead Denver to 
    a title.</p>

    <div class="Players">
    <h2>04 Jayson Tatum</h2>

    <p>Tatum took a major step forward in 2022, leading the Celtics past Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jimmy Butler
    to get the Celtics into the Finals for the first time in 12 years. He sits firmly in my top 5 set on a path to take his 
    all the way back this year as well.</p>

    </figure>

    <div class="Players">
    <h2>05 Stephen Curry</h2>

    <p>You might have thought he was done due to his age and losing KD, but Curry can still be the best player on a championship team. 
    He secured his first Finals MVP award after carving up the best defense in basketball for six-straight games.</p>
